# 🛡️ My Security Journey

Welcome to my public security learning repository.  
This repo documents my hands-on journey in cybersecurity, cloud administration, and secure IT operations.

⚠️ **No production or employer data will ever be included.**  
All examples are generic or lab-based.

## 🧪 Learning Method
1. Research the security concept
2. Build a homelab example
3. Automate or script something useful
4. Document lessons learned
5. Share what works (and what didn’t)

## ✅ Safety Rules
- No internal hostnames, domains, real IPs
- No organization names, GUIDs, or tenant IDs
- No passwords, keys, tokens, or logs containing sensitive IDs
- All configs are sanitized

Secrets are stored outside Git using environment variables:
> See `.env.example` for safe placeholders
